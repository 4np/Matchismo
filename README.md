# Matchismo Project
This is the code for the _Matchismo_ project for the Computer Science [CS139p](http://www.stanford.edu/class/cs193p) course *"Developing iOS 7 Apps for iPhone and iPad"* (2013 / 2014) by Stanford University on [iTunes U](https://itunes.apple.com/us/course/developing-ios-7-apps-for/id733644550).

## Lecture(s)
This code covers the _Matchismo_ project from Lecture 2 and Assignments 1.

## UI
Note that I have developed this with 4" screen (iPhone 5 & 5S) in mind. Running this on a 3.5" screen or simulator may result in los of UI.

## Versions
The code has been tagged in different versions to represent the different stages of development and progressing through the Lectures, Slides and Assignments. From bottom (oldest) to top (most recent) the different stages of development are tagged:

Tag              | What
---------------- | ---
Assignment-1     | Added the code for Assignment 1
Slides-Lecture-2 | Added the code from the slides of Lecture 2
Slides-Lecture-1 | Added the code from the slides of Lecture 1 
Lecture-2        | The code from the end of Lecture 2

This way you can _download_ or _check out_ each stage of development, for example the stage _before_ I add my solution of the assignments, and implement your own solution.
