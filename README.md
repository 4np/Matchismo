# Matchismo Project
This is the code for the _Matchismo_ project for the Computer Science [CS139p](http://www.stanford.edu/class/cs193p) course *"Developing iOS 7 Apps for iPhone and iPad"* (2013 / 2014) by Stanford University on [iTunes U](https://itunes.apple.com/us/course/developing-ios-7-apps-for/id733644550).

## Lecture(s)
This code covers the _Matchismo_ project from Lecture 2 and Assignments 1.

## UI
Note that I have developed this with 4" screen (iPhone 5 & 5S) in mind. Running this on a 3.5" screen or simulator may result in los of UI.

## Versions
The code has been tagged in different versions to represent the different stages of development and progressing through the Lectures, Slides and Assignments. The _Lecture_ tags are probably good starting points for starting with assignments. From bottom (oldest) to top (most recent) the different stages of development are tagged:

Tag              | What
---------------- | ---
[**_0.7_**](https://github.com/4np/Matchismo/releases/tag/0.7) | Completed Assignment 2
[0.6](https://github.com/4np/Matchismo/releases/tag/0.6) | Added the improvement from Lecture 4 (Foundation and Attributed Strings)
[0.5](https://github.com/4np/Matchismo/releases/tag/0.5)     | Updated to code with the changes / additions of Lecture 3
[**_0.4_**](https://github.com/4np/Matchismo/releases/tag/0.4) | Added the code for Assignment 1
[0.3](https://github.com/4np/Matchismo/releases/tag/0.3)     | Added the code from the slides of Lecture 2
[0.2](https://github.com/4np/Matchismo/releases/tag/0.2)     | Added the code from the slides of Lecture 1 
[0.1](https://github.com/4np/Matchismo/releases/tag/0.1)     | The code from the end of Lecture 2

This way you can _download_ or _check out_ each stage of development, for example the stage _before_ I add my solution of the assignments, and implement your own solution.
